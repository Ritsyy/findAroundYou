<h1>Atm-near -me is an website which allows the users to find the cash machines around them.<h1>
<h2> It is an open source webiste so any one can contribute to the project and send new ideas. <h3> 
<h3>The next challanges for the project are:
1) The user should be able to select certain radius around him so the website will only look for the machines in theat specific distance.(kms or miles).
2)Suggest more features or designs. </h3>

Feel Free to contribute and suggest any features.
