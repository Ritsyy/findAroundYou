<h1>Atm-near-me is a website which allows the users to find the cash machines around them.<h1>
<h2> It is an open source website, so any one can contribute to the project and send new ideas. <h3> 
<h3>The next challenges of the project are:
<p>1) The user should be able to select certain radius around him so the website will only look for the machines in that specific distance.(kms or miles).
<p>2)Suggest more features or designs. <h3>

<h3>
Feel free to contribute and suggest any new features.
<p>The direct link to the website is
